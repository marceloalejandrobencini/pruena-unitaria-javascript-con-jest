## Goal of the day:

Today you will be creating a small unit converter in Node.js (JavaScript) using Test Driven Development.

Test driven development means that we will develop the tests first, and the functionalities later.

## Requirements:

1. Before starting to code our project, let's make sure we have Node version 12+, you can type on your terminal the following command: `$ node -v` and it will return your current Node version.

2. Open a new terminal window and write the following command on your terminal: 

```bash
$ node -v
```

## 🔎 Important: 

+ If you are using VSCode you can open a new terminal by clicking on the top menu `terminal -> new terminal`.
