# `01` Setup our project

There are many great alternatives to create unit tests using JavaScript or Node like: Mocha, Jasmin or Jest. 

We decided to use Jest because it is currently the most popular one, has the most documentation, and is better integrated with React.js.

## Package manager

The Jest library can be downloaded into your project through [node package manager (npm)](https://npmjs.com), npm is the most popular package manager in JavaScript/Node.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Before installing Jest, we have to initialize the project with the npm init command, ideal to setup NPM. 

2. Run the following command to start your project using node package manager:

```bash
$ npm init -y
```

Note: if you don't add the `-y` option, it will ask lots of questions that we don't need.

## 💻 Expected result: 

+ If you installed successfully, you will find a `package.json` file on your project root.
