# `02` Choosing your framework

Now it's time to install Jest.

Jest is a 3rd party library (piece of code) ideal for front-end and back-end unit test development.

Like most of the libraries in the world of JavaScript or Node.js we are going to be installing it through NPM.

NPM is a marketplace for JavaScript/Node libraries, almost all the libraries are free and open source and you can download them in just a couple of minutes.

## üìù Instructions:

1. When using the NPM package manager, you can install any 3rd party package or library (like Jest, React, Angular, etc.) by running the following command:

```bash
$ npm install <your_package_name> --save
```

2. You have to replace `<your_package_name>` with the name of your package, in our case:

```bash
$ npm install jest --save
```

Note: if you don't include `--save` it will not be installed properly.

## üíª Expected result:

If your package was installed successfully, you will find that:

+ There is a new folder in your root called `./node_modules` 

+ If you open your `package.json` file, you will find `jest` inside the `dependencies` object like this:

![Jest package](../../assets/jest-package.png)
